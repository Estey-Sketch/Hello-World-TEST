# Hello-World-TEST
My first repository so I can learn Github
Learning and pivoting into tech is just like sales. There's quite a bit of ground work (managing tasks) that needs to be done in order to perform at the higher levels.
Certainly not easy, but far better than walking the streets and selling MFPs.
Stay Strong!
